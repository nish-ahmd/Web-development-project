<<--Status-->>
> All pages are made using reactjs and styling done using css/javascript

> I have not implemented form validation and there are issues with databinding

> I have implemented http request on button clicks for all except the 'StdSelect' page

> All links in the code are links to mockeys created in mockey.io for testing purposes
  These links can be replaced with links to localhost server when implementing sql or
  preferrably mongo db.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
